# Documentation

This folder collects the coding conventions we follow. It now aligns with the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), so please refer to:

- `Coding Style and Formatting.md` for naming, spacing, and layout rules.
- `Coding Practices.md` for the habits that keep safety, performance, testing, and collaboration on track.

The `SOLID.md` and other supplemental documents also describe patterns consistent with this style.
